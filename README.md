# Password Generator
The password generator application enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria they select. 

## How to use the application:

1. Start by clicking the 'Generate Password' button.
2. Several prompts will appear on the screen and you will have to answer the prompts accordingly. 
3. When you have answered the last prompt, your random password will be displayed on the screen.

> *Pay close attention the first prompt that determines the length of your password. Make sure your password is at least 8 characters long and not more than 128 characters.*
